TODO:

Priority:
  done extra well - fix routing for Profile
  done - follow/unfollow button should never show up on currentUser's card
  done - add state and props to wireframe thingy
  add posts and tags
  JWT auth

Not priority:
  allow users to edit their profile - think of a good way to approach this
  NewUserForm
  Why does it take so long to follow/unfollow on the front-end? Can it not make the entire screen blink?
  Add follow/unfollow button to profile- maybe make the button its own component...
  formatting
